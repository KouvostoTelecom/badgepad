# Firmware

The badge supports [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/), which makes the badge to act like a keyboard, instead of a gamepad. You can use `dfu-util`or [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) to flash the firmware. Remember that the original firmware for the badge is available at Disobey
