# Hardware modifications

## OLED screen
Any I2C OLED screen will suffice.

## Rotary encoder


## Part list for screen & rotary encoder mod

| Rotary encoder | EC11 [(breakout board version)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32915420023.html) |
| Badge          | Disobey 2018                                                                      |
| Wires          | 20 - 24 AWG wire                                                                  |
| 2x resistor    | 4,7k - 10k resistors will do                                                      |

Optional, nice to have
- Small button to make static installation for the jumper (to access flashing mode when not having our custom fw in)
- Small portion of breakout board to make nicer installation for screen and encoder

## Part list for gamepad mod

| Part        | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Switches    | Cherry MX (or clones)                   |
| Wires       | 20 - 24 AWG wire                        |
| Badge       | Disobey 2018                            |
| Case        | 3D printed from STLs                    |
| Plate       | 3D printed from STLs                    |
| Keycaps     | MX keycaps can be 3D printed, or bought |
| Heatinserts | M3 heat-insert                          |
| Screws      | 3x15mm self tapping screw               |

### Switches
Any switch type will be fine. We used Gateron, since they are better and cheaper than regular Cherry MX. Kailh is a good budget choice, Outemu is cheaper and worse option. Alps might not be compatible with the given plate.

Linear switches are better for gaming according to some sources.

### Case and plate
To get a cool clear acrylic plate, you might need to do some laser cutting from acrylic. Use 3mm acrylic that is compatible with laser cutting (i.e. **don't get Plexiglass**). 3D printed plate is fine, but will have more flex than acrylic one.

For maximum smoothness, use fine water sandpaper!

### Keycaps
Any MX keycaps are compatible with MX clones. There are a few different keycap profiles. We recommend using DSA or XDA profile keycaps.
