# Customizing keymap

This document describes how you can add your own scripts to the Disobey badge 2018. This makes all kinds of bad USB attacks possible on the badge, but also makes it possible to use the Disobey badge as a macropad for all your needs. For example, you can customize the keymap so that it holds `F13`-`F24` keys, which are supported in Windows, Linux and MacOS, but are rarely used by any of the programs.
